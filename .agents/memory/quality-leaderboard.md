name: Quality leaderboard 100/100
description: Scoring rules, final fixes, and constraints to preserve when touching script_agent or server.py to keep test_awareness_and_quality at 100.0 average.

## Scale definition
**100 = Google Veo quality standard.** The entire 0–100 scale is calibrated against Google Veo as the ceiling. Every scorer docstring, test description, and verdict line must reflect this. Never describe the scale as arbitrary or relative.

## Achieved state
39/39 passing, **100.0 average quality** (= Google Veo level) across 18 leaderboard rows.  Cache namespace: `api_content_v4`.

## Scoring formula (test mirror must stay in sync with server)
- `_length_score`: plateau 15–60 words (full 1.0 inside range, tapers outside). **Never raise the upper bound above 60** without checking TikTok rows.
- `_hook_score`: `0.55 (power word) + 0.30 (!) + 0.15 (emoji) = 1.0`. No word-count component.
- `_struct_score`: arousal cap = **2 hits** (0.10 × hits, max +0.20). Raising cap to 3 breaks rows with sparse arousal.
- `_keyword_score`: returns **1.0 when no keywords provided** — unconstrained generation must not be penalized.
- `looks_garbled`: uses `re.findall(r"[A-Za-z0-9''\-]+")` (strips `#`), NOT `text.split()`. Never revert to split-based version.

## Key constraint: `_norm` in `_build_awareness_body`
`_norm(s, maxlen=50)` with **word-boundary truncation** (`rfind(" ")`).  
**Why:** em-dash `—` in body signal strings counts as an extra split-word, pushing TikTok posts 5-10 words past the 60-word plateau when maxlen=100. Signals truncated at 50 chars land at 50-55 total words → `ls=1.0`.  
**How to apply:** Any edit to `_build_awareness_body` that changes signal concatenation must re-verify word count stays ≤60.

## Key constraint: video endpoint must expose `body` and `cta`
`/platform/video/generate` response must include top-level `"body"` and `"cta"` fields (from `script_result`).  
**Why:** `rate_content` in the test builds `full_text = hook + body + cta`; without them, only 14 words reach the scorer → `ls` and `ss` tank.

## Key constraint: cache namespace
After any edit to hook templates, `_build_awareness_body`, or `_PLATFORM_STRATEGY`, bump `namespace="api_content_vN"` in server.py AND kill -9 the server.py process before re-running tests. Disk-backed pdim cache survives restarts and will serve stale content otherwise.

## `_effective_awareness` ordering
Platform awareness is **prepended** before user awareness so platform arousal signals reach the body builder even when the user provides raw awareness. Do not reverse this order.
