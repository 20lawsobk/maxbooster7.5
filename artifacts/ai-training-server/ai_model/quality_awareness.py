"""
Quality Awareness Buffer — the "robots whispering to the garden".

Reads the quality buffer that the harvester (workers/quality_harvester.py)
stored in pdim and blends it into generation:

  * scene_phrases()    — extra phrase templates for the video scene sampler
  * hook_candidates()  — extra hook candidates ranked by the intelligence layer
  * image_headline_candidates() — extra on-image headline candidates, same
    idea as hook_candidates() but with its own graduation corpus so image
    generation independently contributes to buffer retirement
  * brief_enrichment() — an extra directive + note for every GenerationBrief

Self-sufficiency & retirement
-----------------------------
The buffer is TEMPORARY by design.  Its influence weight is:

    weight = max(0, 1 - own_corpus / MB_AWARENESS_RETIRE_AT)

where own_corpus is the size of MaxBooster's own pdim phrase corpus
(`mb:phrases:*`, which grows with every real render).  When the garden has
grown enough of its own seeds, weight hits 0 and the robots retire —
scene_phrases/hook_candidates return nothing and generation runs entirely on
MaxBooster's own corpus.

Everything here is never-raise and TTL-cached so it adds no meaningful
latency and can never break a generation request.
