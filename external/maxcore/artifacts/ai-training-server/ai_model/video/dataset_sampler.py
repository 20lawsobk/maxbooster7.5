DatasetSampler — scene text backed by two live tiers:

  1. **pdim corpus** (`mb:phrases:<scene_type>`) — phrases accumulated from
     prior generations.  Grows automatically with every render.
  2. **Awareness signals** — live industry context injected by the Node.js
     layer.  Always active, always non-empty: guaranteed to produce output.

Static phrase banks at the bottom of this file are dead code in normal
operation.  They are only reached when *both* pdim is empty *and* awareness
is absent — which should not occur in production.
