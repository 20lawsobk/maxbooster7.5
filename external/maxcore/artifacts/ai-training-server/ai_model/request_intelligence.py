"""
Request Intelligence Layer
==========================

A fast, deterministic, dependency-free pre-generation analysis module shared by
every generation service endpoint (content, text, image, audio, video).

Given a raw generation request it:
  1. Classifies the *intent* of the request (drive streams, awareness,
     engagement, conversion, follower growth).
  2. Infers the likely *audience* and best-practice *tone* for the platform.
  3. Extracts the salient *keywords* from the topic / prompt.
  4. Selects a per-platform *generation strategy* (aspect ratio, hook style,
     CTA style, target word-count window, hashtag count, candidate count,
     sampling temperature).
  5. Produces human-readable *creative directives* plus an *augmented idea*
     string that is fed to the underlying agents to steer better output.
  6. Scores and ranks candidate texts so endpoints can return the best one.

Everything here is pure-python and side-effect free so it can run before the
(slow, gated) transformer inference without adding latency. It is purely
additive — endpoints keep their existing behaviour and merely gain an
`intelligence` block plus higher-quality, better-targeted inputs/outputs.
