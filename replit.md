# Max Booster - AI-Powered Music Career Management Platform

## Overview
Max Booster is an AI-powered, full-stack TypeScript web application designed to empower music artists with comprehensive career management tools. It offers AI-assisted features for social media management, music distribution, analytics, a beat marketplace, career automation, press kit creation, playlist pitching, tour management, merch store integration, sync licensing, publishing rights, A&R submissions, sample clearances, music video production tracking, radio/blog pitching, fan campaigns, revenue intelligence, songwriting, project budget planning, and venue/booking CRM. The platform aims to streamline and optimize various aspects of an artist's career, leveraging AI models fine-tuned specifically for the music industry, with the ambition to become the leading platform for artist career development through intelligent automation and insights.

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development, with clear communication before significant changes. Please prioritize stability and performance. Do not make changes to folder `AI training server/ai_model/` or file `server/services/hybridStorageService.ts` unless explicitly instructed. Ensure that all new features integrate seamlessly with the existing hybrid storage system.

## System Architecture
The Max Booster application uses a monorepo structure, separating concerns into `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`, `boosterstate/`, `server/pocket-dimension/`, and `AI training server/`. The UI/UX emphasizes a clean, responsive design and a Studio DAW-like interface with TopBar, LeftSidebar Browser, MainArea with view tabs (Timeline / Mixer / Node Graph / Flow), and RightSidebar Universal Inspector.

The core of the system is a "Triangle Architecture" data flow: Max Booster pushes all data exclusively to PDIM, MaxCore training server pulls training data from PDIM, and Max Booster pulls trained model weights from MaxCore for inference. PDIM serves as the ONLY unified storage backend, functioning as both a Redis-compatible layer and a persistent object storage system with level-9 Gzip compression and SHA-256 content-addressed deduplication.

Key architectural decisions include:
- All core AI/ML models are in-house, specifically fine-tuned for music artist use cases (e.g., Viral Scoring, Timing Optimization, Algorithm Intelligence) using industry-specific data. MaxCore (`secure-ai-forge.replit.app`) is the sole AI source across all endpoints.
- Microservices-like logical separation within the monorepo for scalability, designed for Replit Autoscale with PDIM (`pocketdimensionstorage.replit.app`) as the shared-state backend.
- Robust authentication with session fixation prevention, JWTs with refresh, and session heartbeat.
- Comprehensive workflow automations managed by `musicWorkflowAutomationService.ts`, and a Unified Content Orchestration System for all content generation.
- Custom in-house AI models exclusively used for Advertisement and Autopilot Systems, integrating an advanced AI Content Stack (v2, v3, v4) for social content and songwriting.
- A Multimodal Content Generation System via `server/services/multimodalGenerationService.ts` orchestrates text, image, audio, and video generation, all calling MaxCore.
- Video Generation Engine, Voice Synthesis Engine, and Python Audio Analysis Engine for media processing.
- Beat Audio Separator for generating MP3s and frequency-band stems from uploaded WAV beats.
- Offline mode for app-wide context and background sync.
- Autopilot Learning Feedback Loop for recording performance patterns.
- Dedicated admin UI for financial configuration.
- `Chain Error Auto-Fixer` and `Platform Auto Error Fixer & Patcher` for system health and runtime patching.
- Profile Claiming System v2 for artist profile management.
- Per-Artist Storefront Deployment System for dynamic domain management and multi-tenant routing, including a `dns-os/` monorepo for a fully self-hosted DNS provider.
- Full DIY DNS Infrastructure including a standalone nameserver package (`dns-node/`), DNSSEC, GeoDNS + EDNS Client Subnet, multi-region nameservers, BGP Anycast, and an EPP Registrar Client.
- Built-in Authoritative DNS Server and DNS Zone Manager for user-managed custom domains and records.
- Domain Registrar System where Max Booster acts as the registrar, handling native domain registration, DNS zone creation, and delegation.
- Multi-Provider DNS Adapter supporting various commercial DNS providers (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Namecheap, AWS Route 53, DigitalOcean, Porkbun).
- Domain Lifecycle Service for domain verification (NS delegation, CNAME, A record, TXT token) and auto-provisioning of CAA records.
- Domain Verification Worker for background polling of custom domains and health sweeps.
- DNS Propagation Check API for real-time propagation status from public DoH resolvers.
- Advanced AI Routing through `unifiedAIController.generateContent()` to MaxCore.
- Seeded, deterministic outcomes for content generation, aesthetic elements, and AI decision-making, including UCB1 Multi-Armed Bandit for topic selection.
- Three-Tier Video Diffusion Architecture: Max Booster → MaxCore Rendering Engine relay → MaxCore AI Content Gateway → MaxCore.
- Performance hardening features include pagination, composite DB indexes, Neon PostgreSQL, request correlation IDs, server-side in-memory API cache, Brotli compression, browser caching, i18n lazy-loading, IndexedDB async query-cache persister, non-blocking Google Fonts, and DNS resource hints.
- Canonical image upload patterns and specific handling for beat marketplace cover art.
- Generated contracts are persisted in the `generated_contracts` PostgreSQL table.
- Marketplace storefront custom-domain security audit resolutions for ownership verification and authentication.
- Storage quota system based on `user_storage_files` table, `mime_type`, and `subscription_tier`.
- Advertising autopilot performance endpoint computes ROI estimates.
